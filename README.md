## Project Architecture

The BHEL Dynamic Forms application follows Angular 19 best practices with a modular, component-based architecture. The project structure includes:

### Core Components

**Dynamic Form Component (`dynamic-form.component.ts`)**
The heart of the application, this component renders forms dynamically based on JSON configuration. It supports multiple field types including text inputs, number inputs, date fields, radio buttons, and complex data tables. The component uses Angular Reactive Forms for robust form validation and state management.

**Inspection Results Component (`inspection-results.component.ts`)**
Displays comprehensive analysis results after form submission, including repair/replace/reject decisions, confidence levels, measurement statistics, and detailed recommendations. The component provides visual feedback through color-coded decision indicators and statistical summaries.

**Main App Component (`app.component.ts`)**
Orchestrates the overall application flow, managing the transition between form input and results display. It integrates the form configuration loading, form submission handling, and results presentation.

### Service Layer

**Inspection Service (`inspection.service.ts`)**
Implements the core business logic for analyzing dimensional measurements and determining component disposition. The service applies tolerance checking, deviation calculations, and decision algorithms based on predefined criteria.

### Data Models

**Form Models (`form.models.ts`)**
Defines TypeScript interfaces for type safety and code maintainability, including FormConfig, FormField, InspectionResult, and related data structures.

## Form Configuration System

The application uses a JSON-based configuration system that allows for flexible form definition without code changes. The configuration structure includes:

## Business Logic Implementation

The inspection analysis system implements sophisticated decision-making algorithms based on dimensional tolerances and measurement statistics.

### Tolerance Specifications

**D1 Dimension Tolerances:**
- Minimum: 10.000 inches
- Maximum: 15.000 inches  
- Nominal: 12.500 inches

**D2 Dimension Tolerances:**
- Minimum: 8.000 inches
- Maximum: 12.000 inches
- Nominal: 10.000 inches

**D3 Dimension Tolerances:**
- Minimum: 5.000 inches
- Maximum: 8.000 inches
- Nominal: 6.500 inches

### Decision Criteria

**REPAIR Decision:**
Applied when components show minor deviations within acceptable repair limits. Criteria include:
- All dimensions within 90%-110% of nominal values
- Maximum of 3 measurements outside tolerance but within repair limits
- No critical safety dimensions compromised
- Confidence level typically 80-90%

**REPLACE Decision:**
Recommended for components showing significant wear but still within replacement consideration. Criteria include:
- Dimensions within 80%-90% or 110%-120% of nominal values
- More than 3 but fewer than 10 measurements outside tolerance
- Significant wear detected requiring replacement
- Confidence level typically 85%

**REJECT Decision:**
Applied to components beyond repair limits or posing safety risks. Criteria include:
- Any dimension below 80% or above 120% of nominal values
- More than 10 measurements outside tolerance
- Critical safety dimensions compromised
- Confidence level typically 95%

## Testing Guide

### Sample Test Data Sets

**Test Case 1: REPAIR Scenario**

## Technical Implementation

### Angular 19 Features Utilized

The project leverages the latest Angular 19 features including:

**Standalone Components:**
All components are implemented as standalone components, eliminating the need for NgModules and simplifying the application structure.

### Form Generation Algorithm

The dynamic form generation process follows these steps:

1. **Configuration Parsing:** JSON configuration is loaded and parsed into TypeScript interfaces
2. **Form Control Creation:** FormBuilder creates appropriate form controls based on field types
3. **Validation Setup:** Validators are applied based on field requirements
4. **Template Rendering:** Angular template dynamically renders form elements
5. **Event Binding:** Form events are bound to component methods for interaction handling

### Measurement Analysis Algorithm

The inspection analysis follows this process:

1. **Data Extraction:** Form data is extracted and measurements are parsed
2. **Tolerance Checking:** Each measurement is compared against defined tolerances
3. **Deviation Calculation:** Percentage deviations from nominal values are calculated
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Counts of within-tolerance and outside-tolerance measurements
5. **Decision Logic:** Business rules are applied to determine repair/replace/reject
6. **Confidence Calculation:** Confidence levels are assigned based on measurement quality
7. **Report Generation:** Comprehensive analysis report is generated with recommendations
